I use some third party services that may set cookies. In particular, I use Google AdSense (to display ads) and Google Analytics<br> (so I can see how much traffic the website receives,<br>
pages visited, the numbers of visitors from different countries, etc). These services provide aggregate data, and I do not collect any<br> personal information about this website's <br>
visitors from those services.</p>
